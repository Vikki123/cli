# Open Commerce CLI


> Note: Our new CLI is in its very early stages. If you find any issues please reports them [here.](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/cli/issues)



## Overview
---
The Open Commerce CLI has been created to optimize speed and simplicity, where even developers who are new to Open Commerce, can now start developing with a few simple commands. Our goal with this tool is to address the challenges caused by excessive memory use and device slowdowns that developers have experienced. The API, Storefront, and Admin applications can now be run independently, freeing up memory and improving performance.

## Prerequisites 
---
Before you can use the Open Commerce CLI, ensure you have all the base requirements for your operating system: 
- We recommend installing [nmv](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 
- [14.18.1 â‰¤ Node version < 16](https://nodejs.org/ja/blog/release/v14.18.1/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation 
---
Before you can use the Open Commerce CLI you need to install the command line tool: 

First install the cli by running: 
```
npm install -g @reactioncommerce/reaction-cli
```
After this, select the cli directory using: 

```
cd cli
```
Then: 

```
 npm install -g
```
You can test to see if it has worked here by running: 

```
Reaction help
```

## Creating a project
---

You can create your Open Commerce project by running:
```
reaction create-project api <your-project-name>
 ```
 This will create an Open Commerce project in the directory <your-project-name>.
Once this is complete, run:
```
cd <your-project-name> 
 ```
Then run:
```
npm install 
```
Finaly run:
```
reaction develop api
  ```
  This will start the Open Commerce GraphQL server and Mongo Server. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

- A sample custom plugin has been installed, and you should see its output in the logs. (Your Sample Plugin)
- To add a new plugin based on our plugin template run:
```
reaction create-plugin api <your-plugin-name>
```
Validate whether the plugin was created in the "custom-packages"
```
cd custom-packages
```
``` 
cd <your-plugin-name>
```
```
npm install 
```
```
reaction develop api
```
 This plugin will now be loaded the next time you start Open Commerce.

## Add the Admin/Storefront 
---
Open Commerce includes an Admin panel for managing your system plus an example storefront implementation so you can see how you would go about building your own.

## Adding the Admin

To add the admin project you can run:
```
reaction create-project admin <your-admin-name> 
```
and a `your-admin-name` directory will be created in the new directory. 

Change to that directory by running:
```
 cd <your-admin-name> 
```
Then run:
```
npm install
```
and you can start the admin project by running:
```
reaction develop admin
```
For more information about developing the admin you can go to Mailchimp Open Commerce Documentation

## Adding a Storefront
To add the example storefront project so you can browse your installation just run:
```
reaction create-project storefront <your-storefront-name>
```
To run the storefront navigate to the newly created storefront directory by running: 
```
cd <your-storefront-name>
```
and run:
```
npm install
```
and then:
```
reaction develop storefront
```
The storefront will be available on port https//localhost:4000

 ## Other Commands

- For a full list of commands run:
```
reaction help
```

- To build a dockerfile that includes your custom code while in the directory you can run: 
```
reaction build <api|admin|storefront>
 ```
- If you're looking to evaluate or demo the Admin, Storefront, and API simultaneously you can run:
```
reaction create-project demo <you-demo-name>
```
```
cd <your-demo-name>
```
Check that the storefront (localhost:4000), graphQL server (localhost:3000) and admin (localhost:4080) are all running (this might take a minute or so).
