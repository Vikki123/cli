# Open Commerce CLI


## Note: Our new CLI is in it's very early stages. If you find any issues please reports them [here.](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/cli/issues)



## Overview
---
Mailchimp Open Commerce is an open-source, API-first, headless commerce platform built using Node.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL. It plays nicely with npm, Docker, and Kubernetes. Open Commerce brings together everything needed to build, deploy, and run online stores.

## Prerequisites 
---
Before you can use the Open Commerce CLI, ensure you have all the base requirements for your operating system: 
- [14.18.1 â‰¤ Node version < 16](https://nodejs.org/ja/blog/release/v14.18.1/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation 
---
Before you can use the Open Commerce you need to install the command line tool: 

First install the cli by running: 
```
npm install -g @reactioncommerce/reaction-cli
```
(on some systems you may need to run this with the `sudo` prefix):

```
sudo npm install -g @reactioncommerce/reaction-cli
```
Once this has installed you need to clone the git repo using the SSH key. You can do this by using: 

```
git clone <SSH Key>
```
After this, select the cli directory using: 

```
cd cli
```
Then: 

```
npm install
```
Then:

```
 npm install -g
```
You can test to see if it has worked here by running: 

```
Reaction help
```


## Creating a project
---
Before you start creating a project, make sure you are not in the CLI directory. You can do this by inputing: 

```
cd ..
```
Then: 
```
cd <choice of folder>
```

Once this is done, you can create your Open Commerce project by running:
```
reaction create-project api my-server
 ```
 This will create an open commerce project in the directory `my-server`. You can name it whatever you want.
Once this is complete, run:
```
cd my-server
 ```
Then run:
```
npm install 
```
If this doesn't work it could be because of the version of EsLint you are running. If this is the case run:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
Finaly run:
```
reaction develop api
  ```
  This will start the Open Commerce GraphQL server and Mongo Server. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
- A sample custom plugin has been installed, and you should see its output in the logs. (Your Sample Plugin)
- To add a new plugin based on our plugin template run:
```
reaction create-plugin api <my-plugin-name>
```
 This plugin will now be loaded the next time you start Open Commerce.

## Add the Admin/Storefront 

Open Commerce includes an Admin panel for managing your system plus an example storefront implementation so you can see how you would go about building your own.

### Adding the Admin
To add the admin project you can run:
```
reaction create-project admin <myadminname> 
```
and a <myadminname> directory will be created in the new directory. Then run:
```
npm install
```
and you can start the admin project by running:
```
reaction develop admin
```
For more information about developing the admin you can go to Mailchimp Open Commerce Documentation

### Adding a Storefront
To add the example storefront project so you can browse your installation just run:
```
reaction create-project storefront
```
To run the storefront navigate to the newly created storefront directory and run:
```
npm install
```
and then:
```
npm run start
```
The storefront will be available on port 4000
